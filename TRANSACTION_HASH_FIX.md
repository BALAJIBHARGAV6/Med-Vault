# ðŸ”§ Dev Mode Transaction Hash Fix

## Issue Resolved
**Problem**: In development mode, clicking "View Transaction on Aptos Explorer" led to an error page showing "Could not find a transaction with version or hash [mock-hash]" because the mock transaction hash doesn't exist on the actual blockchain.

## âœ… Solution Implemented

### 1. **Updated CreateReport.tsx**
- **Before**: Always showed "View Transaction on Aptos Explorer" link
- **After**: Shows different UI based on mode:

#### Development Mode (DEV_MODE=true):
```
âœ… Medical record created successfully in development mode!

ðŸ§ª Development Mode: Transaction simulated
0x10c616b836dd2b25d9395510d7a5dbec16daf9b2d026b3aa471ea9c7bd5c012e
Switch to production mode to create real blockchain transactions
```

#### Production Mode (DEV_MODE=false):
```
âœ… Medical record created successfully!

View Transaction on Aptos Explorer â†’
```

### 2. **Smart Mode Detection**
- Uses `import.meta.env.VITE_DEV_MODE === 'true'` to detect current mode
- Automatically switches between simulated and real transaction display
- No more broken explorer links in dev mode

### 3. **User-Friendly Messaging**
- **Dev Mode**: Clear indication that transaction is simulated
- **Production Mode**: Direct link to Aptos Explorer
- **Visual Distinction**: Orange warning style for dev, green success for production

## ðŸŽ¯ Technical Details

### Code Changes:
1. **Conditional Link Display**: Only shows Aptos Explorer link in production mode
2. **Dev Mode Indicator**: Shows mock transaction hash with clear simulation message
3. **Visual Feedback**: Different styling to distinguish simulated vs real transactions

### Files Modified:
- `src/pages/doctor/CreateReport.tsx`: Updated success message display logic

## ðŸ§ª Testing Results

### Development Mode:
- âœ… No more broken explorer links
- âœ… Clear indication that transaction is simulated
- âœ… Mock transaction hash displayed for reference
- âœ… User guidance to switch to production mode

### Production Mode:
- âœ… Real Aptos Explorer links work correctly
- âœ… Actual blockchain transactions are displayed
- âœ… Standard success flow maintained

## ðŸ”„ User Experience

### Before Fix:
1. User creates medical record in dev mode
2. Clicks "View Transaction on Aptos Explorer"
3. Gets error: "Could not find transaction"
4. Confusion about why it doesn't work

### After Fix:
1. User creates medical record in dev mode
2. Sees clear "Development Mode: Transaction simulated" message
3. Understands this is testing/development
4. Knows how to switch to production for real transactions

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

The application now properly handles both development and production modes:

- **Development**: Safe testing environment with clear simulation indicators
- **Production**: Real blockchain transactions with working explorer links

Users can now develop and test safely without encountering broken transaction links, and the transition to production mode provides the expected real blockchain functionality.
